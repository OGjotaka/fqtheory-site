      <h2><strong>What if coherence is the missing dimension?</strong></h2>
      <p>𝔽(𝔮) proposes a new unified field framework built on the principle of coherence. It suggests that coherence, not just energy or mass, may be fundamental to how spacetime, gravity, light, and even consciousness operate. This model could unify classical and quantum phenomena and explain effects that standard models cannot. The theory bridges mathematics, physics, and emotional-cognitive fields in a new paradigm of resonance.</p>
      <p>We invite thoughtful readers, collaborators, and funders to explore what might be the beginning of something revolutionary.</p>

      <h2>Origin Journal</h2>
      <p>Explore the initial insights, inspirations, and breakthroughs that led to the development of the 𝔽(𝔮) theory. The Origin Journal captures the earliest signal of coherence in this project — a raw and evolving documentation of thought.</p>

      <h2>About the PI</h2>
      <p>JJ Holbrook is a systems theorist, programmer, and interdisciplinary researcher. With a background in biology, advanced mathematics, and computer science, she has spent years studying the intersection of physical laws, consciousness, and information theory. Her current focus is the development and measurement of a proposed coherence framework, 𝔽(𝔮), a unifying model for gravity, quantum phenomenon, emotion, and light.</p>
      <p>JJ is also the architect of Slate CRM systems at the University of Central Missouri, a passionate advocate for democratic principles, and a creative visionary seeking to transform both science and society from the inside out.</p>
