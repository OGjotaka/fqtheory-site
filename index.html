      <h2><strong>What if coherence is the missing dimension?</strong></h2>
      <p><strong>𝔽(𝔮)</strong> proposes a new unifying principle of physics: coherence. Not just energy, not just particles — but wave alignment across all domains. Coherence, in this view, shapes what exists, what persists, and what attracts.</p>
      <p>This model reaches beyond traditional boundaries to link spacetime curvature, quantum behavior, memory formation, signal propagation, and even emotion — all through a shared resonance field. It’s not just a theory of matter. It’s a theory of meaning.</p>
      <p>We welcome scientists, seekers, and skeptics alike. Come explore the math, philosophy, and practical implications of 𝔽(𝔮).</p>

      <h2>Origin Journal</h2>
      <p>This journal contains the raw signal — early thoughts, pattern recognition, and intuitive leaps that formed the backbone of F(q). Part lab notebook, part field log, part philosophical tract, it tracks the emergence of coherence as a formal principle.</p>

      <h2>About the PI</h2>
      <p><strong>JJ Holbrook</strong> is a systems theorist and interdisciplinary researcher with a background spanning biology, mathematics, cognitive science, and software architecture. She currently leads Slate CRM development at the University of Central Missouri, where she has built predictive models for student success and systemic transformation.</p>
      <p>Her work in <strong>𝔽(𝔮)</strong> blends scientific discipline with poetic intuition, proposing a resonance-based framework that unites physical, informational, and emotional phenomena under a single coherence field.</p>
