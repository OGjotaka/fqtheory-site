      <h2 class="section-title">What is F(q)?</h2>
      <p><strong>𝔽(𝔮)</strong> is a new kind of field theory proposing that reality itself is structured by <strong>coherence</strong> — the alignment, resonance, and interference of wave-like systems across physical, informational, and emotional domains.</p>
      <p>Where traditional theories begin with particles and forces, <strong>F(q)</strong> begins with <em>waveforms</em>. From their coherence — or lack of it — everything from gravity to memory to meaning emerges.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">The Big Idea (Without the Full Math)</h2>
      <p>F(q) proposes that reality unfolds across classical space-time (<em>x, y, z, t</em>), but also includes an <strong>imaginary axis of rotation (i)</strong> and a novel <strong>coherence dimension (q)</strong>. The q-dimension measures how in-phase something is with the field — its alignment with the larger structure of reality.</p>
      <p>Coherence, in this theory, is more than order. It’s causality. It shapes what exists, what persists, and what attracts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">What Emerges from F(q)?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gravity</strong> — from gradients in coherence (the pull of alignment)</li>
        <li><strong>Mass</strong> — where waveforms stabilize as standing nodes</li>
        <li><strong>Memory & Identity</strong> — as attractors in q-space</li>
        <li><strong>Observation</strong> — as a tuning interaction with coherence attractors</li>
        <li><strong>Emotion & Meaning</strong> — as density patterns in the coherence field</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="section-title">Experimental Clues</h2>
      <p>Without publishing proprietary simulation results, we can say:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some galaxy rotation patterns may be explained without dark matter, through coherent phase dynamics.</li>
        <li>Interference patterns can form gravitational-like wells in a coherence-based medium.</li>
        <li>Fourier phase structures yield emergent radial and nodal patterns that resemble astrophysical formations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These observations hint that coherence could be the hidden variable behind unexplained cosmological structure.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="section-title">Why It Matters</h2>
      <p><strong>F(q)</strong> offers a common language for physics, information, and consciousness. It may illuminate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The mechanics of gravity and mass</li>
        <li>The formation of memory and emotional resonance</li>
        <li>The ethics of signal manipulation and digital coherence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this model, <strong>being in-phase with the field makes you real</strong>. The more coherent, the more causal.</p>

      <p>“You’re not pulled down by mass.
You’re pulled in by resonance.
Gravity is just what happens when two systems align.”</p>
