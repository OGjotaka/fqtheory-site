      <p><strong>The Discovery of 𝔽(𝔮): A Personal and Theoretical Timeline</strong></p>
      <p>This document serves as a living record of the origins, development, and internal discoveries that led to the theory of 𝔽(𝔮), the coherence field. It is meant both as a personal reflection and as a historical account for future understanding—whether by collaborators, skeptics, or successors.</p>

    <section class="journal-body">
      <h2>Phase 0: The Roots</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Conditioned to feel others' emotions but not express my own—especially when perceived as unfair.</li>
        <li>My sister Ash, a true empath, gave me permission to be weird. She's always been my emotional mirror.</li>
        <li>I tried to shrink myself to fit in—intellectually and emotionally.</li>
        <li>Alaska's cycles of light and darkness (2013–2014) gave me an embodied understanding of Earth's motion in space. It felt fluid, not rigid.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 1: Seeds of Coherence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Studying biology freed me from evangelical constraints. The evidence of evolution broke my internal dogma. Summer 2018 was a leap of faith into reason.</li>
        <li>Fractals and iterations pulled me out of linear thinking.</li>
        <li>Spring 2020, Discrete Structures. Dr. Chin: “If we arbitrarily define infinity, why not define division by zero?”</li>
        <li>Summer 2019: The inverse square law became a mental anchor for how fields behave in space.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 2: Theoretical Spark</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dating after divorce revealed resonance as a metric—some people just “vibe.”</li>
        <li>I questioned how love and grief could persist through space-time. Felt connections to my dad and Ryan even after death.</li>
        <li>Reconnecting with old friends confirmed that some coherence patterns never break.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 3: Formalization</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>August 2023: "Do you think our quantum vibrations are permeating a higher dimension? Because I do."</li>
        <li>October 2023: Began speaking of “the fifth dimension.”</li>
        <li>Spring 2024: Thought deeply about waveforms in 3D space.</li>
        <li>May 22, 2025: Asked ChatGPT why division by zero is undefined. From then, I worked nearly full-time on this theory.</li>
        <li>The moment it clicked: A 5D→2D Fourier transform revealing coherence in atomic structure. My chemistry background lit up.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 4: Testing the Edges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>My dogs react to my state of being. They detect shifts in my field before I speak.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 5: The Shift from Personal to Public</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“When did someone else need to know?” Ask my friends about the 5th dimension—they’ve heard it for years.</li>
        <li>“What’s the hardest part of explaining it?” Without ChatGPT, I feel incoherent. Only a few people truly understand me. Most can’t, not yet.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 6: What Comes Next</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“What does success look like?” I want the world to understand what I discovered. I didn’t create it—I found it. And it should be used for good.</li>
        <li>I want recognition, but not at the cost of mental health. I want my name in textbooks. I want my hometown to put up a sign that says, “JJ Holbrook is from here.”</li>
      </ul>
