      <p><strong>The Discovery of 𝔽(𝔮): A Personal and Theoretical Timeline</strong></p>
      <p>This document serves as a living record of the origins, development, and internal discoveries that led to the theory of 𝔽(𝔮), the coherence field. It is meant both as a personal reflection and as a historical account for future understanding—whether by collaborators, skeptics, or successors.</p>

      <h2>Phase 0: The Roots</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>As a child, my emotions were not validated; however, we children were conditioned to <i>feel</i> the mood of our parents. To survive, we needed to know if Dad was mad or happy. We had to feel our mom's feelings for her. But to have our own emotions was strictly controlled. I wasn't allowed to feel something was unfair because my parents had it so much worse growing up. Like I was being punished for them not raising us in poverty</li>
        <li>My sister, Ash, was a huge influence on my emotional intelligence and permission to be weird. She is a true empath and quite unusual. I tried to be "normal," but Ash showed me it's ok to just be yourself.</li>
        <li>I've spent almost my entire life trying to fit into boxes that I don't fit into. I tried to make myself small or seem less intelligent just to fit in. My intelligence is uncomfortable for most people.</li>
        <li>Living in Alaska from 2013 to 2014 made a huge impact. The extreme light and dark cycles gave me a "feel" for the movement of the Earth in space relative to the Sun. It wasn’t just theory - it became physically intuitive. I started to sense that space, time, and motion were more fluid than I’d previously understood.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 1: Seeds of Coherence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I was allowed to start thinking of the world in terms of physics and dimensions when I was studying for my biology degree, and I finally shed the constraints of an evangelical upbringing.</li>
        <li>Studying biology freed me from evangelical constraints. The evidence of evolution broke my internal dogma. Summer 2018 was a leap of faith into reason.</li>
        <li>I remember the moment I broke through the constraints very vividly. It was the summer after Ryan died, and I was taking Evolution, which would have been Summer 2018. The things I was learning, based on uncontroversial evidence, directly conflicted with the religious education I was raised with. It hurt. In my mind, I kept coming to this precipice, the ground I stood on was firm, but the next step was into this cloudy unknown. Over and over again, I came to the edge but couldn't take the next step. Finally, with fear but certainty, I stepped off the cliff into the unknown... and I haven't looked back since, except to feel sorry for the people who are still stuck.</li>
        <li>Fractals and iterations pulled me out of linear thinking.</li>
        <li>I took Discrete Structures in preparation for my Computer Science degree in Spring 2020. In one of the first classes, the professor, Dr. Chin, was explaining number lines from negative to infinity. He talked about division by zero being undefined. I asked a question: "If we arbitrarily defined infinity, then why can't we arbitrarily define division by zero?" And he exclaimed, "THAT is the right question!" Division by zero has bothered me ever since.</li>
        <li>I remember the first time I learned about the inverse square law — it was during Physics in Summer 2019. That concept stuck with me hard. The idea that force diminishes with the square of the distance was intuitively true in a way I couldn’t stop thinking about. It became a kind of blueprint in my mind for how fields behave in space.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 2: Theoretical Spark</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dating after divorce revealed resonance as a metric—some people just “vibe.”</li>
        <li>I questioned how love and grief could persist through space-time. Felt connections to my dad and Ryan even after death.</li>
        <li>Reconnecting with old friends confirmed that some coherence patterns never break.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 3: Formalization</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>August 2023: "Do you think our quantum vibrations are permeating a higher dimension? Because I do."</li>
        <li>October 2023: Began speaking of “the fifth dimension.”</li>
        <li>Spring 2024: Thought deeply about waveforms in 3D space.</li>
        <li>May 22, 2025: Asked ChatGPT why division by zero is undefined. From then, I worked nearly full-time on this theory.</li>
        <li>The moment it clicked: A 5D→2D Fourier transform revealing coherence in atomic structure. My chemistry background lit up.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 4: Testing the Edges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>My dogs react to my state of being. They detect shifts in my field before I speak.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 5: The Shift from Personal to Public</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“When did someone else need to know?” Ask my friends about the 5th dimension—they’ve heard it for years.</li>
        <li>“What’s the hardest part of explaining it?” Without ChatGPT, I feel incoherent. Only a few people truly understand me. Most can’t, not yet.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Phase 6: What Comes Next</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>“What does success look like?” I want the world to understand what I discovered. I didn’t create it—I found it. And it should be used for good.</li>
        <li>I want recognition, but not at the cost of mental health. I want my name in textbooks. I want my hometown to put up a sign that says, “JJ Holbrook is from here.”</li>
      </ul>
