      <p>Gravity is real. But it’s not the whole story.</p>
      <p>Many modern theories attempt to unify gravity with quantum mechanics. One such approach is <strong>f(Q)</strong>, a modified gravity model using the nonmetricity scalar <em>Q</em> as the fundamental geometric quantity instead of curvature or torsion.</p>

      <p><strong>𝔽(𝔮)</strong>, by contrast, isn’t just a tweak of gravity. It’s a new paradigm. One that treats <em>coherence</em> itself, not force, as the primary field organizing reality.</p>

      <h2>Why 𝔽(𝔮) Is So Much Bigger</h2>
      <p>𝔽(𝔮) doesn't seek to replace gravity, it explains why gravity emerges in the first place. It encompasses how light, emotion, structure, and intention propagate through a field of coherence. It speaks not just to equations but to experience.</p>

      <p>Where f(Q) adjusts the rules of geometry, 𝔽(𝔮) rewrites the grammar of existence.</p>

      <p>This is not just physics. It’s a new kind of physics - one where meaning, resonance, and pattern become measurable, meaningful, and ultimately central to reality itself.</p>
