      <p>Gravity is real. But it’s not the whole story.</p>
      <p>One modern approach to modified gravity is <strong>f(Q)</strong>, which redefines gravity using the <em>nonmetricity scalar Q</em>—a tweak to spacetime geometry that retains a classical foundation.</p>

      <p><strong>𝔽(𝔮)</strong> is something deeper. It doesn’t just modify equations—it reframes the question. This is a coherence-based framework that views <em>form</em>, <em>alignment</em>, and <em>interference</em> as more fundamental than force. The result: a field theory where gravity is not the cause, but the consequence of deeper coherence patterns.</p>

      <h2>Why 𝔽(𝔮) Is More Than Gravity</h2>
      <p><strong>𝔽(𝔮)</strong> doesn’t seek to replace gravity. It explains why gravity—and mass, and memory, and meaning—arise in the first place.</p>

      <p>It offers a framework in which light, emotion, and identity propagate through an underlying coherence field. It speaks not just to measurable forces but to felt experience—resonance, perception, attention, and phase alignment.</p>

      <p>If <em>f(Q)</em> modifies the equations of geometry, then <em>𝔽(𝔮)</em> rewrites the syntax of emergence. It’s not just a new theory—it’s a new substrate for reality.</p>

      <pre><code>∇F(q)² → Gravity
Standing nodes in F(q) → Mass
Attractors in q-space → Memory, Identity, Meaning</code></pre>
